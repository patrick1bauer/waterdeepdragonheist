In the bustling city of Waterdeep, our brave heroes continued their adventure by hiring Broxley to turn their manor into a lively bar. A confrontation with Emmek led to a mug of vinegar being dumped on him. Later that day they made their way to the Yawning Portal, where they searched for Davil Starsong, but even Durnan, the experienced barkeep, didn't know where he was.

Their continued investigation of the Trollskull Alley's explosion reminded them of a description of a "puppet," revealing it to be a nimblewright, often seen in parades held by the House of Inspirations. They journeyed to this temple and were attacked by a metal sparrow, sent by a mysterious figure on the roof. Nalfein's bird quickly destroyed it, causing the figure to hide in the attic.

Undeterred, they entered the temple's great hall, filled with mini-recreations and complex gadgets. They were greeted by Valetta, a dragonborn, who led them to Nim's attic room. After some clever maneuvering by Kaynix, they unlocked the door. Valetta was upset to learn that Nim had made the bird that attacked them and ordered her acolytes to take away Nim's tools and toys.

Their questions led them to a rod-shaped device, which Sloppyjoe sneakily took. This nimblewright detector led them to the Dockward sewers, where they found a signal under the harbor, but just led to an outlet to the harbor.

Determined to continue their search for the midnight dockward serial killer, they searched the alley and bar where recent murders had occurred, but found little of value, even with the help of a cat. Their search for the nimblewright and Urstul took them to the Gralhund Villa, where the detector was whiring at full speed. A fierce battle ensued as they entered the grounds, defeating the undead groundskeeper and his mastiffs.

Inside the villa, they found deceased bodies in the pantry and laundry room and were eventually spotted by  Zhentarim thugs in the main dining hall. Deciding to side with the Gralhund guards, they took care of the Zhentarim with ease.

The session ended with a meeting with Lady Gralhund, who thanked them for their help and revealed she was working with the Zhentarim assassins to get the Stone of Golorr. She claimed she didn't know where the stone was and denied any knowledge of nimblewrights, leaving our heroes with more questions.

Our adventurers now stand ready to face new challenges and uncover deeper mysteries in their journey ahead.
