Hired broxley to manage the manor as a bar.
Dumped a mug of vinegar on Emmek.
Went to the Yawning Portal to find Davil Starsong but he wasn't there, Durnan didn't know either.
They remembered that the desciption of the "puppet" from their investigations described a nimblewright, which were commonly seen in parades hosted by the House of Inspirations.
Going to this temple, they were attacked by a metal sparrow from a mysterious figure on the roof.
Nalfein's bird efficiently dispatched the metal sparrow and the figure hid into the attic.
Entering the temple, they found a great hall with all types of mini-recreations and actual contraptions.
They were greeted by Valetta, a dragonborn, who leads the party up to Nim's attic room after some inquiries. Nim locked himself in but Kaynix was able to teleport in through a small crack and open the door from the inside.
Valetta communicated with Nim and became upset upon hearing that he made the bird that attacked the group.
She instructed several acolytes to remove Nim's tools and toys.
After some investigations, the party inquires about a rod shaped tool that Nim created and Sloppyjoe stealthily sneaked it out. It turned out to be a Nimblewright detector.
The party searches for the evil nimblewright that caused the fireball explosion in the Dockward sewers and found a signal under the harbor, but didn't pursue the search farther.
They went to the alley and bar where the murders were happening, but even with the aid of a cat, they didn't find anything of value.
The party went to the Gralhund villa to follow the trail of Urstul.
They broke in and killed the undead groundskeeper and his two mastifs in the yard.
Searching through the villa, they came upon several bodies in the pantry and the laundry room, and eventually entered combat with Zentarim thugs in the main dining hall. They learned that there is internal conflict within the Zhentarim, but eventually ended up helping the Gralhund guards taking care of the rest of the Zhentarim thugs.
Our party left off talking to Lady Gralhund who was thankful for their asistance and who revealed that she was working with the Zhentarim assassins to claim the Stone of Golorr for herself. She said she doesn't know where the stone is at the moment and claimed that she doesn't know any nimblewrights.
