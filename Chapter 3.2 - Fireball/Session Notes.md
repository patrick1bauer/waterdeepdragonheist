# Recap

In the shadowed corridors of Waterdeep, our valiant adventurers gathered in somber silence around the fallen Sloppyjoe. Under the eerie glow of the moon, Melannor Fellbranch, a conflicted envoy of the Emerald Enclave, emerged from the darkness, drawn by the chilling echoes of fate. With solemn determination, he guided the group to the venerable City of the Dead, beneath the ancient Gold Oak. There, amidst whispered chants and the deep, earthy embrace of the oak's roots, Sloppyjoe was drawn into the sacred soil, purified of poison by Kaynix's newly awakened fire, and miraculously restored to the realm of the living.

Yet, as the veil of death was lifted, so too were the dormant spirits of the graveyard stirred. Five skeletal guardians, enraged by the disturbance of their eternal rest, rose to challenge the party. A fierce battle ensued under the cloak of night, the clattering of bone against steel ringing out like a grim symphony. Though victorious, the clamor attracted the stern gaze of the Emerald Enclave's watchful protectors, who, upon discovering the forbidden ritual, cast out Melannor and our heroes from the sacred grounds and stripped them of their renoun.

As dawn's light crept over Waterdeep, our weary adventurers sought refuge in the comfort of Trollskull Manor. The day brought mundane pursuits; scrolls, armor, and a grateful sober Haldar rewarding their bravery. Although our party is on the outs with the Emerald Enclave, they are gaining rank quickly with the Zhentarim, providing them intel on the Elf killing drow gunslinger and delivering mind reading potions from an empty potion shop to a lady in with a mask and purple cloak and hood. The locals of the party recognize this lady as the Black Viper, a notorious burglar, pickpocket, and assassin who died over a century ago. They followed her to the Rosznar estate in the Sea Ward.

The day concluded with an uneventful stake out of the Dock Ward, but Sloppyjoe's murderer remained elusive. As night fell, they returned to the safety of their manor, unaware that the morning would bring catastrophe.

A fireball, sudden and devastating, shattered the peace of Trollskull Alley, claiming lives and drawing our heroes into a web of intrigue spun with threads of power and dark ambitions. Through their own investigations and the diligent work of the City Watch, the truth emerged: Dalakhar, a gnome sworn to the Open Lord Neverember, had fallen victim to the Zhentarim and the Xanathar's ruthless chase for the Stone of Golorr.

Lost with no direction, their Manor ghost 'Lif" gave them the idea to question the dead for more information. With no resources themselves, they turned to Force Gray to pettion a cleric, but nothing in Waterdeep comes for free. They were quested to learn about a young Bronze Dragon's intentions residing in the depths of the Deep Harbor. After screwing with Shmit, the captian of a small sloop they hired, several times, they ended up with the intel they needed, 150 gold stolen from the dragon, and the local city watch convinced that Shmit has "white powder" aboard his ship. They return to Vajra in the Black Staff Tower to collect renoun and head over to the morgue to continue their investigation with the aid of a cleric. Their questioning of the dead zhentarim assassins resulted in the knowledge that Dalakhar works for The open Lord Neverember, he stole the Stone of Golorr from the Xanathar, and was bringing it to the party in Troll Skull Manor. The Zhentarim leader Urstul Floxin who is in posession of the Stone of Golorr most likely fled to Gralhund Villa where the Zhentarim were hiding. The mysterious machine like figure who threw the fireball in the first place is still at large with no apparent ties to the Zhentarim assassins, Xanathar, or Dalakhar and Lord Neverember.

Thus, the saga of our heroes continues, their thirst for the hoard of dragons bringing them into the middle of the fight for the Stone of Golorr.

We pick up where we left off, our party just left the Morgue after questioning the dead Zhent assassins. They know that Urstul fled to the Gralhund Villa located in the North Ward, but there is no evidence that directly implicates the Gralhunds in the attack. Threads to pull:

* Check out the Gralhund Villa.
* Investigate more about the "puppet" that threw the fire ball
* Wait a day to get the furniture for the Manor
* What to do with the Manor:
    * Talk to Broxley to hire him to manage the Manor
    * Steal brewing recipes from the Guild of Brewers so you don't have to pay Brewer's guild fees.
* Re-connect with Melanor Fellbranch and see what can be done about the Emerald Enclave kicking you out.
* Investigate more about the re-appearance of the Black Viper.
* Talk with Vajra from Force Gray, Davil Starsong from the Zhentarim, or Melannor Fellbranch from the Emerald Enclave to see if they can help each other.

# Skulltroll Manor

* Broxley, male halfling, with mutton chops and bushy eyebrows comes by to compliment the newly renovated furniture and offers to handle the guild memberships and taxes for 250 gold flat fee.

* Emmek Frewn comes by to comment about the shit furniture and lack of offerings and patrons and invites them over to his pub to show them how a fine establishment should look like.

# Puppet

History Check 5:
The description for the puppet by Jezrynne is very similar to the automatons that march in the Day of Wonders parade, the Day of Wonders Parade is sponsored by the local temple of Gond, in the Seaward. The House of INspired Hands, Waterdeeps' temple of Gond, sits on the corner of Seawatch Street and Shark Street.

The House of Inspired Hands looks like a cross between a temple and a workshop. THe symbol of Gond, a toothed cog with four spokes, is displayed prominently. You see the silhouette of a human shape perching on the rooftop. It extends an arm, releasing a tiny metal sparrow into the sky. The bird does a few loops in the air then veers right toward you. Roll initiative.

* Mechanical Bird: AC 15, 1 HP, immune to poison & psychic. Attacks party member at random, deals 2 piercing damage.

The bird is destroyed and the mysterious figure withdraws into the temple's attic through a hatch in the roof.

The temple of Gond is open and abuz with activity, the main hall of the temple holds two dozen marble pedestals, Each one bears a prize-winning invention or a miniature model of some other extraordinary creation. Among the displays are several that stand out:
A 4 foot tall working model of a clock tower rings at the top of every hour. It is made of wood, iron, bronze, and glass, with brass bells and delicate hands formed from solid gold.
A wooden flying machine has wings that flap when it becomes airborne.
A miniature model of a mechanical dragon turtle has a brass plate affixed to its pedestal that reads, "Big Belchy. Sank in Deepwater Harbor on the Day of Wonders in 1363 DR.
A functional "waking helmet" equipped with small articulated metal arms and hands that gently slap the wearer if he or she falls asleep.
A miniature model of a red submarine shaped like a manta ray has a brass plate affixed that reads "The Scarlet Marpenoth. Lantanese submersiblie. Launched in 1489 DR."

While looking at the inventions, the characters are greeted by a dragonborn priest of bronze dragon ancestry. "Such wonderful inventions! My name is Valetta, welcome to the House of Inspired Hands."
