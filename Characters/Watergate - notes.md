### Characters

#### Nalfein (Jeff)

Half Drow

74 years old

Nalfein was born to Kyrnill Kenafin, matron mother of House Kenafin, 10th house of Menzoberranzan. Dinin was 2nd boy of House Kenafin, but was stripped of his title once his sister, Baltana, discovered that he was born from a coupling of the Matron Mother and one of the Overwizards of the Arcane Brotherhood, Cashaan the Red. House Kenafin later defended House Horlbar against an attack by House  Tuin'Tarl. The two houses subsequently joined forces and formed the new House Melarn. His mother, Kyrnill, was named the first High Priestess of House Melarn, but a new Matron Mother, Ker Horlbar, was named. Once the houses were merged, Kalfein was ordered by the Matron Mother of the new House to leave Menzoberranzan and explore the surface world for 100 years before he would be allowed back into the city of his Mother and House Melarn.  Matron mother Melarn hopes that Nalfein does not come back alive, as that would only strengthen High Priestess Kyrnill, her most powerful rival in the House.

That was 35 years ago, when Nalfein was 39 years old.  Young for a Drow, but not so young for a Hollowborn (Half-Elf).  It took Nalfein approx. 2 years on the surface to simply be able to survive the surface in the bright sunlight.  His half-human eyes more adjusted to the visible spectrum than that of a full-blooded Drow.  But after that period of adjustment, Nalfein began to search for a path to take his life on the surface.  He had been trained from a young age to expect to train in Sorcere, the wizard academy in Menzoberranzan.  However, he had only spent 14 years in Sorcere before he was exiled. Not half the time most Drow Wizards spent at the academy.  Nalfein found that the magic that he studied in Sorcere did not help him on the surface world.  Therefore, when he became accustomed to the Surface, he made his way to Luskan to find a teacher at the Host Tower Arcane.  It took him almost 5 years to earn his way into the Tower as a servant, where we would spend another nearly 20 years just trying to prove himself to the masters of the Tower that he was worthy to learn from them the ways of the Weave.  Finally, Druette The Raven, a black robe Overwizard, allowed him to study among her apprentices.  

Even though Cashaan the Red was at the Host Tower in Luskan, Nalfein never brought his lineage to his attention, nor did he ever make this known to anyone he had ever met.  That fact cost him the life he knew in his home, and it was not something that he was proud of.  He knew that one day, he would make it known to Cashaan who and what he was.  And he was determined to be a more powerful wizard than his father when that day came.  He knew that day would eventually come, but he knew it was a long time from now.

Because Nalfein had an affinity for Magic, that he alone knew was hereditary, he eventually became one of Druette’s favored apprentices. Even though his Drow blood made him a target of scorn and mistreatment among the other apprentices.  He was finally named Druette’s primary apprentice within the Tower at Luskan.  Druette was the Overwizard of Waterdeep, so she spent most of her time between Luskan and Waterdeep, among her other duties in the Moonshae Isles.  After another 3 years working in the Tower in Luskan, Nalfein was selected to take “The Test”, which would either make him a Wizard or kill him. He became a Wizard without any lasting harm or debilitation.  Druette sent him to Waterdeep to look after her affairs in the city, where he has been operating for the last 2 years.  While Druette is away from Waterdeep, which she has been for the last 18 months, there is not that much to do at the Host Tower of Waterdeep, so Nalfein uses his time to adventure on his own.  Druette encourages this of her apprentice Wizards and allows them to leave for extended periods to allow them to grow in their power knowing that any gains that they make will be used to further her power and control.  

Nalfein is aware of a Drow Mercenary Guild that is operating out of most of the major cities on the Sword Coast, called Bregan D'aerthe.  Nalfein knows that the group operates out of Waterdeep at times, but he has not yet crossed paths with any confirmed members of theirs.  As he had gone decades without ever seeing another Drow on the surface world, Nalfein is eager to come across the band of Mercenary Drow and try to gain some information about his House and his mother.  Being an exiled Hollowborn, this can be a tricky proposition, as some Drow will look at him as a comrade, but if his true identity were known, those same Drow could decide that his life should be forfeited to gain some kind of favor with Matron Mother Melarn.  One of Nalfein’s favorite Inns in Waterdeep was the Watergate Inn, as he knew that if Bregan D’aerthe was to surface, it would most likely be the Watergate Inn that he would find them.

#### Kaynix Emmer (Cody)

Human Circle of Wildfire Druid

25 years old

Apart of a Druid grove called “The Nomadic Flame” where basically they go around recording history and collecting relics and every so often the grove is called to decide where to remove ruins of past cities, temples, villages, etc. where people are no longer living or have just abandoned all together to allow a regrowth of nature and eventually civilization

When Kaynix was young, the Ashen Warriors were on a mission to collect an old relic. On the day of the Sun's highest zenith (which is also when the fire god Kossuth as at his strongest), they came to Pirate Isle near the lands of Thay. While scouting for relics, they came across a very young boy who displayed a Kossuth symbol relic around his neck and had an aura of smoke - so it was clear that he had a lot of power and magic and was also connected to Kossuth (which was common for Thayans). It took many Ashen Warriors to capture the boy and take the Kossuth relic. They brought the boy back to the Nomadic Flame and spent many weeks 'cleansing' his mind which destroyed his memory. While performing the magical rituals to purify his mind, they were able to see that he had a magical lineage stemming from The Red Wizards of Thay, despite not being a wizard. The Nomadic Flame repurposed Kaynix's power and potential for their own missions.

#### Muffin Moonshadow (Marissa)

Wood Elf Sorcerer

1200 years old

In the serene elven town of Eldertree, nestled deep within the heart of the mystical Whispering Woods, Muffin Moonshadow was born to a family of skilled wood elves. From a young age, Muffin exhibited a natural affinity for the arcane arts, and her latent sorcerous abilities became apparent as she unintentionally conjured small illusions of dancing lights and gentle breezes. 

As Muffin grew older, she became more attuned to the magical energies coursing through the Whispering Woods. The eldewood elves recognized her potential and decided to train her in the art of sorcery. Her training involved communing with the spirits of the forest, learning the language of the trees, and mastering the balance between nature and magic. 

However, her idyllic life took an unexpected turn on the day she was in deep meditation under the Sacred Moon tree when suddenly an ominous force of orcs known as the Bunion Troopers emerged on the outskirts of Eldertree. Strange creatures, armored with bone, wreaked havoc upon the once-peaceful town. In a fierce battle that unfolded beneath the towering branches of Eldertree, Muffin utilized her newfound sorcerous powers to aid her fellow elves in repelling the orc invaders. Spells of dazzling light and ethereal barriers flowed effortlessly from her fingertips, but the battle was fierce, and the wood elves faced a formidable foe. 

In the midst of the chaos, Muffin witnessed the orc warriors being led by a colossal and malevolent sorcerer, who was once kin to the wood elves, who sought to exploit the Eldwood's magic for dark purposes. This sorcerer was named Bunzilla. Sparks of magic filled the air as the two sorcerers clashed, each wielding the power of the Eldwood. Muffin Moonshadow's determination, fueled by her love for her home and its mystical inhabitants proved stronger.

With a burst of radiant energy, Muffin Moonshadow banished the corrupted sorcerer's dark influence from the Eldwood, restoring balance to the ancient forest. The elves hailed her as a hero of the town. With her home safe, she now craved exploration. Armed with her arcane knowledge and desire to learn new things, Muffin journeyed through enchanted forests, treacherous mountains, and mystical realms in pursuit of quests all while meeting a strange rogue named Sloppyjoe Mahmah.

#### Russan Ashrith (Robert)

Summer Eladrin (Elf) Arcane Archer

300 years old

Part of the Nomadic Flame druid grove. He is part of the Ashen Warriors who are the watchman and defenders of the grove. As the grove relocates, they are responsible for protecting the historic records and relics that they collect from past cities and temples. He is traveling with Kaynix Emmer seeking a new artifact.

#### Sloppyjoe MahMah (Alec)

Half Elf Rouge

30 years old

In the ridiculous city of Watergate, SloppyJoe MahMah burst onto the scene as a rogue with a passion for mischief and stupidity. Born into a family of jesters, he traded juggling balls for nimble fingers, becoming known for his silly heists and quick quips.

SloppyJoe tended to fat finger his thievery, often breaking his bobby pins and thieves' tools. Fueled by a desire for both belly laughs and material gain, he orchestrated heists that left the city scratching its head and chuckling simultaneously.

Amidst the uproar, SloppyJoe's partner in hilarity, a rotund barn owl named Hootie, perched on his shoulder, her hoots sounding more like a SCREE than a hoot. With feathers fluffier than a cotton marshmallow and a face shaped like a half-cut apple, Hootie added an unexpected charm to his silly heists, turning each theft into a sideshow of laughter. Hootie's favorite food is ironically apple pie, hence the pudge.

His moral compass, though spinning like a wacky wheel, leaned more towards the joy of the caper than any true wrongdoing. Watergate became his circus tent, and every theft turned into a comedic spectacle. SloppyJoe's quick wit and Hootie's comically plump presence made them the talk of the town, a duo that danced between shadows with a flair for foolishness and fun.

### Factions

#### Xanathar

In the shadowed corners of Waterdeep, whispers circulate about the Xanathar, a notorious criminal syndicate shrouded in mystery. They are rumored to be led by the enigmatic Xanathar, whose identity is a closely guarded secret, known only to a select few within the organization. The Xanathar are involved in various illicit activities throughout the city, from smuggling and theft to the more sinister trades of assassination and blackmail. They operate mostly from the underbelly of the city, their influence creeping like ivy through the streets of Waterdeep. As you navigate the complexities of the city, be wary, for the eyes of the Xanathar are said to be ever-watchful, and its reach extends into places both high and low. Crossing paths with this faction could lead to dangerous encounters or valuable, albeit risky, alliances.

While they are often associated with dark deeds and ruthless tactics, the Zhentarim also provide services and protection to those who can afford their price. Their members range from skilled warriors to cunning rogues, all united under the banner of mutual profit and advancement. As you delve into the intrigues of Waterdeep, you may find the Zhentarim to be valuable allies, dangerous enemies, or complex players in the city's multifaceted political landscape.

Bregan D'aerthe is a secretive, mercenary organization predominantly composed of drow.

#### Emerald Enclave

The Enclave in Waterdeep, a sprawling metropolis far removed from the tranquility of your grove, serves as a bastion of nature within the confines of urban development. In this city of stone and politics, the Emerald Enclave strives to preserve the balance between civilization and the wild, acting as stewards of parks, rivers, and natural spaces amidst the urban sprawl. The Enclave is more than just a group of nature enthusiasts; it's a network of druids, rangers, and others who share a deep connection with the earth and its creatures. They are the silent guardians of natural harmony in a place where it's constantly threatened by the encroachment of civilization. Members of the Enclave often find themselves mediating conflicts between the city's expansion and the needs of the natural world, sometimes putting them at odds with powerful political and commercial interests. They are guardians of ancient knowledge and protectors of sacred relics that hold the key to the city's natural history and legacy. The relic you seek, shrouded in mystery and lore, could be a vital piece of the natural world's past

### Previously on Waterdeep

Previously on Waterdeep: our intrepid adventurers found themselves in the bustling epicenter of intrigue and mystery, the City of Splendors - Waterdeep. Amid the echoes of clinking glasses and raucous laughter in the legendary Yawning Portal tavern, our heroes' destinies intertwined, setting the stage for an epic saga of wealth, danger, and power.

As alliances were formed over meetings and thievery, the night's revelry was shattered by a sudden eruption of chaos - a brawl of unforeseen ferocity, challenging our adventurers' mettle and forging their bonds in the crucible of combat. But this was merely the overture to the labyrinth of adventure that lay ahead.

With the dust settled and the tavern's peace precariously restored, the legendary Volothamp Geddarm emerged from the shadows, presenting our heroes with a tantalizing offer that proved to be more than meets the eye.

The quest was simple: find Volo's friend floon, but following this thread exposed our adventurers to a secret that is slowly spreading through Waterdeep: A huge cache of gold is hidden somewhere in the city and everyone wants it.

Navigating the treacherous alleys and dark corners of Waterdeep, our adventurers experienced the aftermaths of factions scrambling to find anyone or anything that can point them towards the gold.

Every clue uncovered, and ally gained, brought them closer to untold wealth, but not without peril. For in Waterdeep, trust is a commodity as rare as the dragons themselves, and betrayal lurks around every corner.

Will our heroes have what it takes and claim the treasure that awaits? Or will the shadows of Waterdeep swallow them whole, their names forgotten like those who have fallen before them?

Stay tuned as alliances are formed and tested, secrets uncovered, and the very heart of Waterdeep is revealed in this thrilling saga of ambition, valor, and treachery. This is 'Waterdeep: Dragon Heist' The quest for the dragon's hoard has only just begun, and in the City of Splendors, only the cunning will survive.

This session will be all about building connections within the city and gaining trust to later obtain information and aid in the hunt for the dragons. There are many factions within the city all with their own motives, biases and secrets to hide.

But before we get ahead of ourselves, we last left off with our adventurers recently aquiring the deed to Trollskull Manor, located in Trollskull Alley. Excited to see their new real estate aquisition, the party approaches the manor. Four stories tall and boasting balconies, a turret, and five chimneys, this abandoned building is one of the grandest in Trollskull Alley.

Upon entering, it is clear the first floor used to be a tavern with a taproom, but has been utilized since as a dormitory with deteriorating cots throughout. There is broken furniture, tarnished silverware, casks of wine that have turned to vinegar, and worthless detritus. The tavern's other rooms are all empty, except for cobwebs, dust, and harmless rats.

Our party began the session by entering the abandoned and ruined Trollskull Mannor, which quickly turned out to be haunted by a strange poltergeist named Lif. Lif would smash plates, kick up dust, and write messages in the grimy windows. Any actions taken to harm the manor would cause the poltergeist to become angry and any actions to clean or repair were met with aid in return. Several guild member came to offer their services which were promptly denied by the party, as they were busy exploring trollskull alley to manage their reparations on their own. They all pitched in to buy new furniture, made homemade candles to make the place smell like eucaliptus, and otherwise strenghtened themselves with new weapons and spells. Word spread quickly about the party's rescue of Reneer and several factions approached them with invitations to join. Nalfein, Muffin, and Sloppyjoe joined Force Grey by passing the intiation test of climbing Mount Waterdeep and obtaining intel from the monk who lives in a cave. Kaynix, Russan, Sloppyjoe, Muffin, and Nalfein all joined the Emerald Enclave by killing scarecrows terrorizing the undercliff's livestock, and as they were on their quest to figure out who's killing the zhentarim elfs in the Dockward, an epic battle took place between Kaynix, Russan, Sloppyjoe, and the enemy who was a Drow gunslinger, the likely culprit of the elf killings. The 3 of them almost killed the gunslinger while he was trying to get away, but at the last second, the gunslinger turned around and shot Sloppyjoe with his poison pistol, killing him and getting away.
