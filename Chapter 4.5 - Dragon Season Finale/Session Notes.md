# Kaynix Hidden Backstory
When Kaynix was young, the Ashen Warriors were on a mission to collect an old relic. On the day of the Sun's highest zenith (which is also when the fire god Kossuth as at his strongest), they came to Pirate Isle near the lands of Thay. While scouting for relics, they came across a very young boy who displayed a Kossuth symbol relic around his neck and had an aura of smoke - so it was clear that he had a lot of power and magic and was also connected to Kossuth (which was common for Thayans). It took many Ashen Warriors to capture the boy and take the Kossuth relic. They brought the boy back to the Nomadic Flame and spent many weeks 'cleansing' his mind which destroyed his memory. While performing the magical rituals to purify his mind, they were able to see that he had a magical lineage stemming from The Red Wizards of Thay, despite not being a wizard. The Nomadic Flame repurposed Kaynix's power and potential for their own missions.
