Here is the context of my D&D game:
Characters:

Nalfein
Half Drow
74 years old
Nalfein was born to Kyrnill Kenafin, matron mother of House Kenafin, 10th house of Menzoberranzan. Dinin was 2nd boy of House Kenafin, but was stripped of his title once his sister, Baltana, discovered that he was born from a coupling of the Matron Mother and one of the Overwizards of the Arcane Brotherhood, Cashaan the Red. House Kenafin later defended House Horlbar against an attack by House  Tuin'Tarl. The two houses subsequently joined forces and formed the new House Melarn. His mother, Kyrnill, was named the first High Priestess of House Melarn, but a new Matron Mother, Ker Horlbar, was named. Once the houses were merged, Kalfein was ordered by the Matron Mother of the new House to leave Menzoberranzan and explore the surface world for 100 years before he would be allowed back into the city of his Mother and House Melarn.  Matron mother Melarn hopes that Nalfein does not come back alive, as that would only strengthen High Priestess Kyrnill, her most powerful rival in the House.
That was 35 years ago, when Nalfein was 39 years old.  Young for a Drow, but not so young for a Hollowborn (Half-Elf).  It took Nalfein approx. 2 years on the surface to simply be able to survive the surface in the bright sunlight.  His half-human eyes more adjusted to the visible spectrum than that of a full-blooded Drow.  But after that period of adjustment, Nalfein began to search for a path to take his life on the surface.  He had been trained from a young age to expect to train in Sorcere, the wizard academy in Menzoberranzan.  However, he had only spent 14 years in Sorcere before he was exiled. Not half the time most Drow Wizards spent at the academy.  Nalfein found that the magic that he studied in Sorcere did not help him on the surface world.  Therefore, when he became accustomed to the Surface, he made his way to Luskan to find a teacher at the Host Tower Arcane.  It took him almost 5 years to earn his way into the Tower as a servant, where we would spend another nearly 20 years just trying to prove himself to the masters of the Tower that he was worthy to learn from them the ways of the Weave.  Finally, Druette The Raven, a black robe Overwizard, allowed him to study among her apprentices.  
Even though Cashaan the Red was at the Host Tower in Luskan, Nalfein never brought his lineage to his attention, nor did he ever make this known to anyone he had ever met.  That fact cost him the life he knew in his home, and it was not something that he was proud of.  He knew that one day, he would make it known to Cashaan who and what he was.  And he was determined to be a more powerful wizard than his father when that day came.  He knew that day would eventually come, but he knew it was a long time from now.
Because Nalfein had an affinity for Magic, that he alone knew was hereditary, he eventually became one of Druette’s favored apprentices. Even though his Drow blood made him a target of scorn and mistreatment among the other apprentices.  He was finally named Druette’s primary apprentice within the Tower at Luskan.  Druette was the Overwizard of Waterdeep, so she spent most of her time between Luskan and Waterdeep, among her other duties in the Moonshae Isles.  After another 3 years working in the Tower in Luskan, Nalfein was selected to take “The Test”, which would either make him a Wizard or kill him. He became a Wizard without any lasting harm or debilitation.  Druette sent him to Waterdeep to look after her affairs in the city, where he has been operating for the last 2 years.  While Druette is away from Waterdeep, which she has been for the last 18 months, there is not that much to do at the Host Tower of Waterdeep, so Nalfein uses his time to adventure on his own.  Druette encourages this of her apprentice Wizards and allows them to leave for extended periods to allow them to grow in their power knowing that any gains that they make will be used to further her power and control.  
Nalfein is aware of a Drow Mercenary Guild that is operating out of most of the major cities on the Sword Coast, called Bregan D'aerthe.  Nalfein knows that the group operates out of Waterdeep at times, but he has not yet crossed paths with any confirmed members of theirs.  As he had gone decades without ever seeing another Drow on the surface world, Nalfein is eager to come across the band of Mercenary Drow and try to gain some information about his House and his mother.  Being an exiled Hollowborn, this can be a tricky proposition, as some Drow will look at him as a comrade, but if his true identity were known, those same Drow could decide that his life should be forfeited to gain some kind of favor with Matron Mother Melarn.  One of Nalfein’s favorite Inns in Waterdeep was the Watergate Inn, as he knew that if Bregan D’aerthe was to surface, it would most likely be the Watergate Inn that he would find them.

Kaynix Emmer
Human Circle of Wildfire Druid
25 years old
Apart of a Druid grove called “The Nomadic Flame” where basically they go around recording history and collecting relics and every so often the grove is called to decide where to remove ruins of past cities, temples, villages, etc. where people are no longer living or have just abandoned all together to allow a regrowth of nature and eventually civilization
When Kaynix was young, the Ashen Warriors were on a mission to collect an old relic. On the day of the Sun's highest zenith (which is also when the fire god Kossuth as at his strongest), they came to Pirate Isle near the lands of Thay. While scouting for relics, they came across a very young boy who displayed a Kossuth symbol relic around his neck and had an aura of smoke - so it was clear that he had a lot of power and magic and was also connected to Kossuth (which was common for Thayans). It took many Ashen Warriors to capture the boy and take the Kossuth relic. They brought the boy back to the Nomadic Flame and spent many weeks 'cleansing' his mind which destroyed his memory. While performing the magical rituals to purify his mind, they were able to see that he had a magical lineage stemming from The Red Wizards of Thay, despite not being a wizard. The Nomadic Flame repurposed Kaynix's power and potential for their own missions.

Muffin Moonshadow
Wood Elf Sorcerer
1200 years old
In the serene elven town of Eldertree, nestled deep within the heart of the mystical Whispering Woods, Muffin Moonshadow was born to a family of skilled wood elves. From a young age, Muffin exhibited a natural affinity for the arcane arts, and her latent sorcerous abilities became apparent as she unintentionally conjured small illusions of dancing lights and gentle breezes. 
As Muffin grew older, she became more attuned to the magical energies coursing through the Whispering Woods. The eldewood elves recognized her potential and decided to train her in the art of sorcery. Her training involved communing with the spirits of the forest, learning the language of the trees, and mastering the balance between nature and magic. 
However, her idyllic life took an unexpected turn on the day she was in deep meditation under the Sacred Moon tree when suddenly an ominous force of orcs known as the Bunion Troopers emerged on the outskirts of Eldertree. Strange creatures, armored with bone, wreaked havoc upon the once-peaceful town. In a fierce battle that unfolded beneath the towering branches of Eldertree, Muffin utilized her newfound sorcerous powers to aid her fellow elves in repelling the orc invaders. Spells of dazzling light and ethereal barriers flowed effortlessly from her fingertips, but the battle was fierce, and the wood elves faced a formidable foe. 
In the midst of the chaos, Muffin witnessed the orc warriors being led by a colossal and malevolent sorcerer, who was once kin to the wood elves, who sought to exploit the Eldwood's magic for dark purposes. This sorcerer was named Bunzilla. Sparks of magic filled the air as the two sorcerers clashed, each wielding the power of the Eldwood. Muffin Moonshadow's determination, fueled by her love for her home and its mystical inhabitants proved stronger.
With a burst of radiant energy, Muffin Moonshadow banished the corrupted sorcerer's dark influence from the Eldwood, restoring balance to the ancient forest. The elves hailed her as a hero of the town. With her home safe, she now craved exploration. Armed with her arcane knowledge and desire to learn new things, Muffin journeyed through enchanted forests, treacherous mountains, and mystical realms in pursuit of quests all while meeting a strange rogue named Sloppyjoe Mahmah.

Russan Ashrith
Summer Eladrin (Elf) Arcane Archer
300 years old
Part of the Nomadic Flame druid grove. He is part of the Ashen Warriors who are the watchman and defenders of the grove. As the grove relocates, they are responsible for protecting the historic records and relics that they collect from past cities and temples. He is traveling with Kaynix Emmer seeking a new artifact.

Sloppyjoe MahMah
Half Elf Rouge
30 years old
In the ridiculous city of Watergate, SloppyJoe MahMah burst onto the scene as a rogue with a passion for mischief and stupidity. Born into a family of jesters, he traded juggling balls for nimble fingers, becoming known for his silly heists and quick quips.
SloppyJoe tended to fat finger his thievery, often breaking his bobby pins and thieves' tools. Fueled by a desire for both belly laughs and material gain, he orchestrated heists that left the city scratching its head and chuckling simultaneously.
Amidst the uproar, SloppyJoe's partner in hilarity, a rotund barn owl named Hootie, perched on his shoulder, her hoots sounding more like a SCREE than a hoot. With feathers fluffier than a cotton marshmallow and a face shaped like a half-cut apple, Hootie added an unexpected charm to his silly heists, turning each theft into a sideshow of laughter. Hootie's favorite food is ironically apple pie, hence the pudge.
His moral compass, though spinning like a wacky wheel, leaned more towards the joy of the caper than any true wrongdoing. Watergate became his circus tent, and every theft turned into a comedic spectacle. SloppyJoe's quick wit and Hootie's comically plump presence made them the talk of the town, a duo that danced between shadows with a flair for foolishness and fun.

Story:

Our adventure begins in a tavern, amidst the cobblestone streets and towering spires. 

The Yawning Portal is a famous inn and tavern located in the Castle Ward of Waterdeep. Adventurers can meet all sorts of colorful characters here. The place is a stone building with a slate roof and several chimneys. Most of the ground floor is taken up by the tavern's common room, which contains a 40-foot-diameter open well (Actually the outer shell of a sunken stone tower) that descends 140 feet to the first level of the Undermountain, the sprawling dungeon under Waterdeep. A rope-and-pulley mechanism is used to lower adventurers into the well and hoist them out. The upper floors of the Yawning Portal contain comfortable, nicely appointed rooms for guests. 

Russan and Kaynix are on their quest to find and preserve relics. Their grove (The Nomadic Flame) has a connection with a faction within the city with similar ideals called the Emerald Enclave. The Enclave in Waterdeep serves as a bastion of nature within the confines of urban development. In this city of stone and politics, the Emerald Enclave strives to preserve the balance between civilization and the wild, acting as stewards of parks, rivers, and natural spaces amidst the urban sprawl.

* Introduce Russan and Kaynix.

Russan and Kaynix are at the Yawning Portal to meet with a member of the Enclave, Melannor Fellbranch. Melannor is a friendly but humorless half-elf druid who also invited a local half-drow Wizard apprentice, Nalfein. Melannor believes that Nalfein could share his knowledge on historical and magical artifacts within the city since he works under Druette The Raven, a black robe Overwizard of waterdeep. Druette has been out of the city for the past 18 months and Nalfein is meeting on her behalf.

* Introduce Nalfein.  

These 4 characters, Russan, Kaynix, Nalfein, and Melannor are all sitting at a table, drinking, eating, and sharing their past adventures, as is customary in the famous Yawning Portal before talking business.
What are they drinking/eating?

* Roleplay the conversation until it is revealed that Nalfein does not in fact know much about the specific artifact Kaynix and Russsan are searching for.

On the other side of the tavern, we come to a group of 4 misfit friends who are enjoying their night out at the tavern. They came to socialize and listen to their friend Mattrim "Threestrings" Mereg play his lute. Threestrings is a seemingly socially awkward human bard who's name comes from the fact that his lute only has three strings. He is roaming around the tavern playing his lute, and is a regular performer at the Yawning Portal. Unbeknownst to the rest of the tavern, this act is a distraction for petty theft. With patrons drinking, dancing, and clapping to the tunes their guards are down and we meet the thief of the group. This character has bright orange, sloppy hair on his head and a small barn owl perched on his shoulder. He is dancing with everyone and otherwise looks like he's having harmless fun, but his definition of fun is different. He dances up to a lady who has a silver ring embeded with a purple stone on her finger and attempts to steal it while giving her a majestic dancing twirl.

Sloppyjoe, please roll a dextertity check. (10 to pass)

The ring comes off easily during the twirl without her noticing. After the twirl, Sloppyjoe dances with several other patrons before leaving the dancefloor with no trace.

* Introduce Sloppyjoe

Lastly, sitting at the bar watching their friend Threestrings play and Sloppyjoe's shenanigans, we have two girls enjoying their drinks. We have a 7 foot tall half-orc named Yagra Stonefist, and a wood elf sorceress named Muffin Moonshadow. Yagra, like Sloppyjoe grew up in Waterdeep and normally partakes in petty theft, but has recently been hired as a mercenary to protect a Zhentarim negotiator which demands her to be more discrete. Yagra finds the job boring but keeps it because it pays well.

The Zhentarim, as you all know from Baulder's Gate 3, are also known as the Black Network, a name that often emerges in hushed tones. This faction is a powerful and widespread organization, known for its mercenary operations and clandestine activities. The Zhentarim seek to expand their influence through any means necessary, be it through trade, intimidation, or espionage. While they are often associated with dark deeds and ruthless tactics, the Zhentarim also provide services and protection to those who can afford their price. Their members range from skilled warriors to cunning rogues, all united under the banner of mutual profit and advancement.

Next to Yagra, we have Muffin Moonshadow.

* Introduce Muffin.

The sounds of gamblers yelling and drunken adventurers singing bawdy songs nearly drown out the off-key strumming of Threestrings a couple tables over.

Then all the noise is eclipsed by a shout: "Ya Pig! Like killen' me mates, does ya? Yagra is hit by a wild, swinging punch from a male human whose bald head is covered with eye-shaped tattoos. Four other humans stand behind him, ready to jump into the fray. The half-orc cracks her knuckles, roars, and leaps at the tatooed figure - but before you can see if blood is drawn, a crowd of spectators clusters around the brawl. What do you do?

* 3rd round of the brawl:

Shouts of alarm suddenly ring out as a hulking creature climbs up out of the shaft in the middle of the tap-room - a monster with watry green skin, a tangled nest of wiry black hair, a long, carrot-shaped nose, and blood-shot eyes. As it bares its yellow teeth and howls, you can see that a half-dozen bat-like creatures are attached to its body, with three more circling above it like flies. Everyone in the tavern reacts in fear except for the barkeep, Durnan, who shouts, "Troll!"

Most tavern patrons and staffers flee or take cover at the sight of the troll.

The stirges attack the nearest characters as Durnan draws his great-sword, springs over the bar, and confronts the monster himself. He calls onto the characters to focus on slaying the stirges.

After the dust has settled with the troll's body unconsious on the floor, Durnan looks at everyone and says "You fought well". A figure pushes against the tide of patrons staying clear of the monster to greet the band of characters who stepped up to fight.
"You be adventurers, am I right? I could use your help. Let's find a table to talk, shall we?"
The figure who approached you storkes his mustache, adjusts his floppy hat, and tightens his scarf. "Volothamp Geddarm, chronicler, wizard, and celebrity, at your service. 
"I trust you've noted the violence in our fair city these past tendays. I haven't seen so much blood since my last visit to Baulder's Gate! But now I fear I have misplaced a friend amid this odious malevolence."
"My friend's name is Floon Blagmaar. He's got more beauty than brains, and I worry he took a bad way home a couple nights ago and was kidnapped - or worse... If you agree to track him down with all due haste, I can offer you 10 dragons a piece now, and I can give you each ten times that when you find Floon. May I prevail upon you in my hour of need?"

The party agrees to join up forces and find floon together.

Volothamp: "Floon is a *very* handsome human male in his early thirties with wavy red-blond hair. He was wearing princely garb two nights ago last time I saw him at the Skewered Dragon Tavern. I recommend you search there"

The quest was simple: find Volo's friend floon, but following this thread exposed our adventurers to a secret that is slowly spreading through Waterdeep: A huge cache of gold is hidden somewhere in the city and everyone wants it.

The party heads towards the skewered dragon and questions the locals for information.
The Skewered Dragon is a dark, bawdy tavern in the Dock Ward.

They fail their persuasion checks but eventually find out that there is an old zhentarim hideout from their friend Yagra Stonefist.

Entering the hideout was tedious and they quickly took care of the kenku hiding inside.
Reneer was hiding in a closet waiting to be resuced and graciously thanks them and explains that floon was captured by the Xanthar becuase of their similar appearnce.

The party recalls that there are eyeball symbols on some sewer manhole covers and decide to follow the trail of eyeballs through the sewers to find floon.

After several hours, they find a Xanathar sewer hideout where they take care of some goblins, fight a grey ooze and save Floon from a mind flayer who manages to escape.

They safely return with Floon back to Volo who thanks them very much, but doesn't have the gold as he prommised. Instead he offers the party the deed to a Manor in Trollskull Alley.

Excited to see their new real estate aquisition, the party approaches the manor. Four stories tall and boasting balconies, a turret, and five chimneys, this abandoned building is one of the grandest in Trollskull Alley.

Upon entering, it is clear the first floor used to be a tavern with a taproom, but has been utilized since as a dormitory with deteriorating cots throughout. There is broken furniture, tarnished silverware, casks of wine that have turned to vinegar, and worthless detritus. The tavern's other rooms are all empty, except for cobwebs, dust, and harmless rats.

The manor quickly turned out to be haunted by a strange poltergeist named Lif. Lif would smash plates, kick up dust, and write messages in the grimy windows. Any actions taken to harm the manor would cause the poltergeist to become angry and any actions to clean or repair were met with aid in return. Several guild member came to offer their services which were promptly denied by the party, as they were busy exploring trollskull alley to manage their reparations on their own. They all pitched in to buy new furniture, made homemade candles to make the place smell like eucaliptus, and otherwise strenghtened themselves with new weapons and spells. Word spread quickly about the party's rescue of Reneer and several factions approached them with invitations to join. Nalfein, Muffin, and Sloppyjoe joined Force Grey by passing the intiation test of climbing Mount Waterdeep and obtaining intel from the monk who lives in a cave. Kaynix, Russan, Sloppyjoe, Muffin, and Nalfein all joined the Emerald Enclave by killing scarecrows terrorizing the undercliff's livestock, and as they were on their quest to figure out who's killing the zhentarim elfs in the Dockward, an epic battle took place between Kaynix, Russan, Sloppyjoe, and the enemy who was a Drow gunslinger, the likely culprit of the elf killings. The 3 of them almost killed the gunslinger while he was trying to get away, but at the last second, the gunslinger turned around and shot Sloppyjoe with his poison pistol, killing him and getting away.
