# Recap
In the bustling city of Waterdeep, a diverse group of adventurers found themselves entwined in a quest that would test their mettle, challenge their alliances, and unearth a secret that could shake the very foundations of the city. Among them were Nalfein, a half-Drow wizard with a complex heritage and a thirst for acceptance; Kaynix Emmer, a human druid from the Nomadic Flame, driven by a mission to preserve nature's balance; Muffin Moonshadow, a wood elf sorcerer with a deep connection to the mystical forces of the forest; Russan Ashrith, a Summer Eladrin arcane archer, guardian of history and protector of the druidic grove; and Sloppyjoe MahMah, a half-elf rogue with a penchant for mischief and a heart of gold, accompanied by his faithful, rotund barn owl, Hootie.

Their journey began in the Yawning Portal, a tavern that serves as a crossroads for adventurers. Here, they crossed paths and formed a bond over a tavern brawl, shared objectives, and mutual respect. The adventurers' path led them through a series of perilous encounters, from the dark, bawdy taverns of the Dock Ward to the secretive hideouts of the Zhentarim and the Xanathar Guild. They faced kenku ambushes, traversed the city's treacherous sewers, and even scared off a mind flayer to rescue Floon Blagmaar, a friend of the renowned chronicler Volothamp Geddarm. Their success earned them the deed to Trollskull Manor, a haunted but promising base of operations that they would come to call home.

As they set about restoring the manor and making a name for themselves in Waterdeep, the adventurers joined forces with local factions, including Force Grey and the Emerald Enclave, undertaking missions that would benefit the city and its denizens, as well as gaining much valued trust within the factions. Their growing reputation as heroes in Waterdeep brought them admiration, but also drew the attention of darker forces.

In their quest for an in with the Zhentarim, the party found themselves locked in a fierce showdown with a Drow gunslinger, whose methodical serial killings had left the Dock Ward in fear. The battle was intense and fraught with danger. Kaynix's quick thinking foiled the gunslinger's initial assault on a local half-elf they were following, providing a glimmer of hope amidst the darkness. Russan's arrows flew true, tearing through the gunslinger's defenses, while Sloppyjoe's scimitars danced with deadly precision, his blades striking deep, pushing their foe to the brink of defeat. Victory was within their grasp as the gunslinger, desperate and wounded, attempted to flee.

But fate had a cruel twist in store. As the gunslinger attempted his escape, he fired one last shot that struck Sloppyjoe, mortally wounding him with a poisonous kiss. Time seemed to slow as Sloppyjoe collapsed, his life's adventures flashing before his eyes. Memories of laughter, daring thefts, and the warmth of newfound companionship swirled together in a distressing farewell. His friends rushed to his side, their hands trembling as they tried to stop the bleeding, but it was too late: poison coursed through his veins. Sloppyjoe's heartbeat slowed, his breaths grew fainter, each one a whispered goodbye to the world he loved.

In those final moments, Hootie, his ever-faithful owl, nuzzled up against him, her soft "hoo" a tender lament for her departing friend. Sloppyjoe's tear-filled eyes met hers one last time, reflecting the moon's light, a silent sorry. And then, as the shadows of the alley claimed him, silence enveloped the night.

# Dockward Streets

We continue where we left off last. Our party was on the hunt for a midnight serial killer in the Dock Ward. Their attempt to protect more half-elf sailors from meeting their fate was a mixed result, A drunk Heldar was saved, but his murder was replaced by another half-elf: Sloppyjoe. As our party rushes to Sloppyjoe during his last moments, our mysterious drow gunslinger vanishes into the night.

Heldar, still drunk, was watching the whole ordeal as if it happened in slow motion and finally came to the realization that he was the original target of the night.
"Hooollly SHit" he stutters
"Hoooooooolly shit" he yells, a panic attack setting in. His breathing getting faster and faster.
He looks around in paranoia and spots a cloaked figure heading towards everyone in the alley.
Not waiting for another murder to happen, he books it out of the alley.

The party has a couple seconds before the mysterious figure is upon them. What do you do?

The man uncovers his hood to reveal that he's Melannor Fellbranch.
"Ah its just you guys. I was out on my way back home when I heard a shots coming from the alley" as he gestures around himself.
He then sees Sloppyjoe's lifeless body on the ground.
"Oh. My... Is Sloppyjoe?... Dead?"
"We need to get him to the City of the Dead right away. We still have a chance to save him, but we need to act fast."
"Wait, no. We shouldn't. It's not right."
He seems conflicted on what to do.
"There's an old ritual passed down within the Emerald Enclave for our studies, but it is forbidden, the Enclave tenets forbid it."

History Check: 5

* The order of nature must be preserved in all its iterations.
* Any force that would disrupt that order had to be defeated.
* The Enclave would always provide aid to anyone left fatigued or suffering injury.

"I would love to help, but I can't. I am bound to let nature take it's course."

Persuasion check: 5

"Alright. But we need to do this right away."

He leads the party to the City of the Dead, the largest graveyard in Waterdeep. Silently walking through the labrynth of tombstones carrying Sloppyjoe with you, you arrive at the base of a huge golden oak tree, its waxy leaves swaying and glistening in the moonlight.

"Place him here"
Melannor gestures at a flat spot under the tree where there's more roots than dirt.

"Now I need to know. How exactly did Sloppyjoe die? Anything life threatening will need to be remedied before we begin, otherwise he'll just die again, and we only have one shot at this."
He opens his pack, takes out a medkit and begins to bandage the bullet wound.

Make a medicine check to see if the bullet is still inside.

* If the characters bring up that the bullet was laced with poison.
"I hope you got the antitode from the gunslinger, they must have had it on them when dealing with poisonous weapons."

* Since the party let the gunslinger escape, they don't have the antidote

Melannor, on his knees, finishes bandaging Sloppyjoe and sighs with defeat.
"Well, looks like there's nothing else we can do, unless by some miracle you have cleansing waters of Eldath or the flame of Kossuth."
"Hell, who am I kidding. None of you are a red wizard of thay."

Make a history check as he begins to pack up his bags.

The Red Wizards of Thay, are notorious and nefarious ruling class of the inhospitable but well-inhabited country of Thay. Historically they owed their power to being cruel slavers, demonolgists, and arcane experimenters, before most of their numbers wholly dedicated themselves into creating anation of undead. They worship the deity Kossuth, the god of elemental fire and purification through fire, as well as Shar, the mistress of the night, the godess of darkness.

* Keep dropping hints until Russan reveals Kaynix's hidden past.
* After the poison is purified, the ritual can begin.

With Sloppyjoe's cleansesd body laying on the roots of the golden oak, Melannor begins the ritual.
He teaches a chant to the other casters in the party and the chanting begins.
Throughout hours of chanting, roots of the tree very slowly crack and writhe around Sloppyjoe's lifeless body, slowly pulling it underground.
After the body is no longer visible, Melannor stops and silence takes over the graveyard. Everyone stares silently at the roots for what seems like an eternity.

* Pause for like 5 seconds

Suddenly an arm shoots up from the ground. It grabs the roots and pulls them away. Sloppyjoe Lives! Hootie swoops in from the branch she was sitting on and nuzzles up to his head on his dirt covered shoulder.
As Sloppyjoe frees himself from his grave, several other hands pop out of the ground around the tree, grabbing the ankles of anyone standing too close. These hands don't look like sloppyjoes' They have no flesh.
6 Skeletons dig themselves out of the dirt. Roll for initiative.




After the party successfully defeats the undead, a couple members of the Emerald Enclave appear and question the party.
"Grave robbers! Stop right there."


. The party members can either tell them the truth or lie with a deception check. Either way, if the other Emerald Enclave members find out this forbidden ritual has been cast to revive Sloppyjoe, then Melannor and the entire party are immediately revoked of their status in the Emerald Enclave and kicked out of the graveyard.
