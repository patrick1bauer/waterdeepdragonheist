Welcome to Watergate, the City of Splendors, a place brimming with intrigue, wealth, and endless opportunities. This bustling metropolis is the heart of the Sword Coast, a melting pot of cultures, factions, and political intrigue. In Watergate, coin is king, gold is known locally as "dragon" or "dragons" and fortunes change with the toss of a die. 

Waterdeep is a city of firm laws and swift justice. Adventurers hell-bent on slaughter and plunder won't fare well in the City of Splendors. The punishments for assault, arson, theft, and murder are severe, regardless of the reason for the crime.

Our adventure begins in a tavern, amidst the cobblestone streets and towering spires. 

The Yawning Portal is a famous inn and tavern located in the Castle Ward of Waterdeep. Adventurers can meet all sorts of colorful characters here. The place is a stone building with a slate roof and several chimneys. Most of the ground floor is taken up by the tavern's common room, which contains a 40-foot-diameter open well (Actually the outer shell of a sunken stone tower) that descends 140 feet to the first level of the Undermountain, the sprawling dungeon under Waterdeep. A rope-and-pulley mechanism is used to lower adventurers into the well and hoist them out. The upper floors of the Yawning Portal contain comfortable, nicely appointed rooms for guests. 

Russan and Kaynix are on their quest to find and preserve relics. Their grove (The Nomadic Flame) has a connection with a faction within the city with similar ideals called the Emerald Enclave. The Enclave in Waterdeep serves as a bastion of nature within the confines of urban development. In this city of stone and politics, the Emerald Enclave strives to preserve the balance between civilization and the wild, acting as stewards of parks, rivers, and natural spaces amidst the urban sprawl.

* Introduce Russan and Kaynix.

Russan and Kaynix are at the Yawning Portal to meet with a member of the Enclave, Melannor Fellbranch. Melannor is a friendly but humorless half-elf druid who also invited a local half-drow Wizard apprentice, Nalfein. Melannor believes that Nalfein could share his knowledge on historical and magical artifacts within the city since he works under Druette The Raven, a black robe Overwizard of waterdeep. Druette has been out of the city for the past 18 months and Nalfein is meeting on her behalf.

* Introduce Nalfein.Â  

These 4 characters, Russan, Kaynix, Nalfein, and Melannor are all sitting at a table, drinking, eating, and sharing their past adventures, as is customary in the famous Yawning Portal before talking business.
What are they drinking/eating?

* Roleplay the conversation until it is revealed that Nalfein does not in fact know much about the specific artifact Kaynix and Russsan are searching for.

On the other side of the tavern, we come to a group of 4 misfit friends who are enjoying their night out at the tavern. They came to socialize and listen to their friend Mattrim "Threestrings" Mereg play his lute. Threestrings is a seemingly socially awkward human bard who's name comes from the fact that his lute only has three strings. He is roaming around the tavern playing his lute, and is a regular performer at the Yawning Portal. Unbeknownst to the rest of the tavern, this act is a distraction for petty theft. With patrons drinking, dancing, and clapping to the tunes their guards are down and we meet the thief of the group. This character has bright orange, sloppy hair on his head and a small barn owl perched on his shoulder. He is dancing with everyone and otherwise looking like he's having harmless fun, but his definition of fun is different. He dances up to a lady who has a silver ring embeded with a purple stone on her finger and attempts to steal it while giving her a majestic dancing twirl.

Sloppyjoe, please roll a dextertity check. (10 to pass)

The ring comes off easily during the twirl without her noticing. After the twirl, Sloppyjoe dances with several other patrons before leaving the dancefloor with no trace.

* Introduce Sloppyjoe

Lastly, sitting at the bar watching their friend Threestrings play and Sloppyjoe's shenanigans, we have two girls enjoying their drinks. We have a 7 foot tall half-orc named Yagra Stonefist, and a wood elf sorceress named Muffin Moonshadow. Yagra, like Sloppyjoe grew up in Waterdeep and normally partakes in petty theft, but has recently been hired as a mercenary to protect a Zhentarim negotiator which demands her to be more discrete. Yagra finds the job boring but keeps it because it pays well.

The Zhentarim, as you all know from Baulder's Gate 3, are also known as the Black Network, a name that often emerges in hushed tones. This faction is a powerful and widespread organization, known for its mercenary operations and clandestine activities. The Zhentarim seek to expand their influence through any means necessary, be it through trade, intimidation, or espionage. While they are often associated with dark deeds and ruthless tactics, the Zhentarim also provide services and protection to those who can afford their price. Their members range from skilled warriors to cunning rogues, all united under the banner of mutual profit and advancement.

Next to Yagra, we have Muffin Moonshadow.

* Introduce Muffin.

The sounds of gamblers yelling and drunken adventurers singing bawdy songs nearly drown out the off-key strumming of Threestrings a couple tables over.

Then all the noise is eclipsed by a shout: "Ya Pig! Like killen' me mates, does ya? Yagra is hit by a wild, swinging punch from a male human whose bald head is covered with eye-shaped tattoos. Four other humans stand behind him, ready to jump into the fray. The half-orc cracks her knuckles, roars, and leaps at the tatooed figure - but before you can see if blood is drawn, a crowd of spectators clusters around the brawl. What do you do?

* 3rd round of the brawl:

Shouts of alarm suddenly ring out as a hulking creature climbs up out of the shaft in the middle of the tap-room - a monster with watry green skin, a tangled nest of wiry black hair, a long, carrot-shaped nose, and blood-shot eyes. As it bares its yellow teeth and howls, you can see that a half-dozen bat-like creatures are attached to its body, with three more circling above it like flies. Everyone in the tavern reacts in fear except for the barkeep, Durnan, who shouts, "Troll!"

Most tavern patrons and staffers flee or take cover at the sight of the troll.

The stirges attack the nearest characters as Durnan draws his great-sword, springs over the bar, and confronts the monster himself. He calls onto the characters to focus on slaying the stirges.

After the dust has settled with the troll's body unconsious on the floor, Durnan looks at everyone and says "You fought well". A figure pushes against the tide of patrons staying clear of the monster to greet the band of characters who stepped up to fight.
"You be adventurers, am I right? I could use your help. Let's find a table to talk, shall we?"
The figure who approached you storkes his mustache, adjusts his floppy hat, and tightens his scarf. "Volothamp Geddarm, chronicler, wizard, and celebrity, at your service. 
"I trust you've noted the violence in our fair city these past tendays. I haven't seen so much blood since my last visit to Baulder's Gate! But now I fear I have misplaced a friend amid this odious malevolence."
"My friend's name is Floon Blagmaar. He's got more beauty than brains, and I worry he took a bad way home a couple nights ago and was kidnapped - or worse... If you agree to track him down with all due haste, I can offer you 10 dragons a piece now, and I can give you each ten times that when you find Floon. May I prevail upon you in my hour of need?"

"Floon is a *very* handsome human male in his early thirties with wavy red-blond hair. He was wearing princely garb two nights ago last time I saw him at the Skewered Dragon Tavern. I recommend you search there"

The Skewered Dragon is a dark, bawdy tavern in the Dock Ward.
