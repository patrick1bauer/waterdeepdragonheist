In the bustling port city of Waterdeep, the late autumn winds howl over the rooftops, the weather cools and smoke can be seen coming from chimneys as citizens begin to heat their homes. Leaves are turning from the vibrant orange and red to brown and start to litter unswept side streets. Business is constantly churning as ventures rise and fall. One such business, A dilapidated manor in the North Ward was recently aquired and transformed into an up and coming tavern named "Lif's Ginza." Run by a ghost bartender and an unlikely group of adventurers, the tavern is quickly becoming a beloved spot for the locals. With high hopes, this group sets their sights on expanding their collection of rare beers and wines.

However, their quest for new recipes is but a fraction of their mission. They are on the trail of the fabled Stone of Golorr, a sentient artifact that holds the key to a massive stash of dragons hidden somewhere within Waterdeep. Every major faction in Waterdeep is vying for this prize, and our heroes are no exception.

In their recent exploits, our party pursued a nimblewright that fled the Gralhund villa with the Stone of Golorr. Armed with their newly acquired nimblewright detector, they tracked its presence to a fleet of three ships docked in the Great Harbor. Our fearless rogue Sloppyjoe, rendered invisible, infiltrated one of the ships. His sticky fingers pilfered some gold and a fabulous pompous wig, but his greed got the best of him and led to his capture in the captain's quarters. Soon after, the entire party was rounded up and brought before Zardoz Zord, the fleet's enigmatic owner. Intrigued by the adventurers, Zardoz invited them to a lavish dinner aboard his private yacht, where he claimed the nimblewrights were merely for entertainment and denied any knowledge of the Stone of Golorr.

Undeterred, the party's relentless search led them to a grimy pile of garbage where the elusive nimblewright was finally discovered. After a brief skirmish, they subdued the creature and brought it back to their manor for questioning. Though the nimblewright had little to say, a small map found in its pocket hinted at its destination for delivering the Stone.

Following the map, they arrived at the residence of a lamp lighter named Fenerus, only to find the aftermath of a brutal conflict. The walls were marked in blood with the symbol of the Xanathar, and none other than Lady Laerel Silverhand, the Open Lord of Waterdeep, confronted them about the Stone. Though wary of her intentions, she directed them to a local Xanathar sewer hideout, instructing them to bring the Stone to her at the Seven Masks Theater in the Dock Ward.

Descending into the disease infested sewers, the party battled through the filth and faced a host of duergar, goblins, kobolds, and even a ravenous mimic. We pick up here, with our heroes deep within the hideout, searching for the Stone of Golorr amidst the shadows and dangers of the undercity.

* Slipping through the back:
"You see actors and stagehands bustling about nad the director arguing with the playwright while the stage manager looks on helplessly."

"On the stage, actors walk through their scenes and read their lines to a mostly empty theater."
"Watching the rehersal form the front row while smoking a pipe is Rongquan, the owner of the theater."

"The play, Shapphiria's Booty, is a romantic comedy about a blue-haired madam named Shapphiria who runs a thieves' guild out of a festhall. When a charming sea captain arrives with a hold full of booty from a faraway land, Shapphiria decides to steal it. Zaniness ensues when she falls in love with the first mate, who is half her age, while the captain falls in love with her. On one side of the stage is a backdrop resembling the deck of a ship; the other side is decorated to look like a madam's parlor in a brothel, complete with a gaudy chandelier and a fainting couch."

* If players meet the play's leading lady:

"Westra Moltimmur, the play's leading lady, is one of Waterdeep's greatest treasures, and the cast and crew seem very protective of her. Now in her seventies and having been married no fewer than seven times, she has a brisk sense of humor and zest for life."

"I would be wary of Rongquan, he isn't what he appears to be."

"I've seen several dark elves watch over him and he uses subtle gestures to communicate with them. I don't recognize the language though, maybe you guys would know."

* Soon thereafter, the stage manager notices the characters and escorts them to Rongquan.

"My friends, don't be discouraged. The wind is blowing in our direction! I've learned that Fenerus Stormcastle was arrested by the City Watch for theft and taken to a courthouse in the Castle Ward to face the judgement of a magister. No doubt he hid the stone before his capture. You must speak to him right away. You'll need to devise some sort of ruse to get close to Fenerus. I urge against violence, or you might find yourself locked up beside him."
