"What did he do?"

"I heard you have aquired a new tavern, is this correct?"
"Who works at your tavern?"
"Who does the most work at the tavern?"
"Who does the least work at the tavern?"
"Would you like to throw that person under the bus and blame all this on them?"
"Can I get a lifetime discount on drinks when I come?"
"What about drow escorts? Do you have any of those?" *LOOKING AT JEFF*
"What's the decor like?" *Give the players a shitty self-portrait of the magistrate to hang*

* Put Muffin (Marissa) on the stand

"Why did you all murder the guards?"
"Do you think it's right to murder public servants?"
