3. Hard labor while in jail. (+1 exhaustion)

* Charge the players
1 count of prison break
2 counts of murder (each)

* Question all the players
"Do you have legal council?"
* When the players select someone, Ma'am Sir will appoint anyone else to be the "lawyer"
"Why were you at the court house?"
"What were you two (alec and cody) doing in the bathroom for so long, my cleric says you entered and never came out"
* If the players say they were actually using the bathroom, then:
"How big was the poop?"
"How do you know Fenerus Storm Castle?"

"Do any of you have any pets?"
* if they say yes or the pets are in the room, bring out the owl feather and say it was found in the prison cells.
* Charge the owl with 2 counts of murder.

* Put Sloppyjoe (Alec) on the stand
* Question the rest of the party if they know him.
* Pit the party against him.

* Put Nalfein (Jeff) on the stand
"So. Tell me, why are you drow?"
"How did you become drow?"
"How does it feel being drow?"
"Do you deny being of Drow herritage?"
"Are you single?"
"What are you doing later today?"
"You are guilty of being drow. No more questions."

* Put Russan (Robert) on the stand
"How do you know Fenerus Stormcastle?"
"Fenerus looks like your brother."
"You're a bad brother. Family always comes first. Tisk tisk"
"Why did you break him out?"
"What did he do?"

* Put Muffin (Marissa) on the stand
"What is your name"
"I heard you have a vocal gift. How long have you practiced the art of the Trollbark yodeling?"
"Please sing me your best Trollbark yodel. I haven't heard any since I was a wee child."
* Performance check
Good: "Ahh such soothing melodies." *Looks at cleric* "Clear my schedule Eduardo, i'm going on vacation to the Trollbark forests."
Bad: "Ahh, my ears!" *Looks at cleric* "Eduardo, clear my schedule. I can't do this right now. I'm going on vacation."



* Put Kaynix (Cody) on the stand
"I heard you have aquired a new tavern, is this correct?"
"Who works at your tavern?"
"Who does the most work at the tavern?"
"Who does the least work at the tavern?"
"Would you like to throw that person under the bus and blame all this on them?"
"Can I get a lifetime discount on drinks when I come?"
"What about drow escorts? Do you have any of those?" *LOOKING AT JEFF*
"What's the decor like?" *Give the players a shitty self-portrait of the magistrate to hang*

* Murder charges
"Why did you all murder the guards?"
"Do you think it's right to murder public servants?"
"Why did you kill the guards? You should have murdered my dumb cleric instead."

* Cleric comes in and whispers to the magistrate.
"Ah. New information has surfaced in this trial."
"You are now charged with the theft of hundreds of thousands of dragons (gold) from the citizens of waterdeep."
* If the players lied about the stone of golorr:
"As well as perjury for lying under oath."

"Our open lord Laeral did let me know that she's looking for a stone that suspiciously resembles the one that I now know is in your posession."







"But, under the circumstances of the situation, if a promise of a generous donation of 20,000 gold were to be made, I would be willing to drop all charges."
