Searching the docks using the nimblewright detector, the party found two ships where the detector was going off. They made Sloppyjoe invisible who snuck onto the ship to investigate. He stole 12 gold and a wig, and when searching through the captain's quarters, he was detected. The whole party was rounded up and confronted by Zardoz Zord, the fleet captain of three entertainment ships in Waterdeep. He invited the party to dinner to gain more information on them later that day.

Wanting to get back some renoun with the Emerald Enclave, the party meets Melannor Fellbranch who was demoted to door holder. He reveals that the Enclave is still looking for the necromancer in the City of the Dead and that if the party finds them, they could clear their names.

Staked out Meloon in the Yawning Portal and found out about his quarrels with his talking axe for Vajra at Force Gray. Have not reported to Vajra yet. While staking out Meloon, Davil Starsong finds them and wants to meet, but was immediately arrested by the city watch due to the bloody fight with the Zhentarim in the Gralhund Villa.

Attended opera to meet with Mirt from harpers during the intermission.
Searched for horse, found horse and got info about Davil and Yagra Stonefist to share with Mirt from harpers. +1 Harpers renoun.

While searching the city for the Stone of Golorr, the nimblewright detector found a nimblewright hiding in a pile of garbage, which resulted in combat. They subdued the nimblewright and brought it back to the manor for questioning. The nimblewright didn't have much to say, but they found a map leading to where the party believes the Stone of Golorr might be: The residence of a lamp lighter named Fenerus Stormcastle. The walls were painted with fresh blood in the shape of th Xanathar symbol. As they were going to continue their search for tracks on the streets, they ran into Laerel Silverhand, the Open Lord of Waterdeep. The party didn't trust her, but she did point them to the direction of a nearby Xanather hideout.

The party made their way into the sewers where they caught the sewer ick (2 days from now they will get symptoms) and started combat with a bunch of duergar, goblins, kobolds, and in the aftermath, a mimic. The party found some gold, blinding arrows, and 2 health potions. We leave the party
