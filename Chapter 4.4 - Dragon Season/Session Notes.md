# Intro
Waterdeep in the fall is a city of vibrant hues and crisp air, with the scent of fallen leaves and the distant salt of the Sea of Swords mingling in the breeze. The grand towers and winding streets of the city are cloaked in a patchwork of reds, oranges, and yellows as autumn takes hold. The bustling city is alive with activity, as citizens and travelers alike prepare for one of the most anticipated events of the fall season: the Day of Wonders. On this day, the city becomes a showcase of marvels, with mechanical wonders and arcane innovations brought forth by the inventive minds of the Temple of Gond.

The streets are lined with mechanical creatures of all shapes and sizes, crafted with meticulous detail by the faithful of Gond. Gears whirr and click as clockwork birds flutter above the crowds, their metal wings catching the autumn sunlight in a dazzling display. On the ground, brass-and-copper hounds bound along, their tails wagging as they interact with curious onlookers. Towering over the throngs are the more complex constructs: humanoid automatons with intricate jointed limbs, demonstrating their strength by lifting heavy objects or their dexterity by performing delicate tasks. The Temple itself has outdone previous years, unveiling a magnificent mechanical dragon that roars with the sound of grinding metal, its eyes glowing with an inner fire fueled by alchemical mixtures. This parade of machines begins at the Temple of Gond and winds its way through the city and eventually ends in the Dock Ward where the Sea Maiden's Faire, the fleet of opulent ships commanded by the flamboyant Zardoz Zord (Who you know to be Jarlaxle in disguise), is partaking in the festivities. The Faire adds an air of exotic mystery to the city, with its colorful tents and lavish displays set up along the narrow streets. Performers from the Faire mingle with the mechanical creatures, weaving through the crowds with acrobatic grace, their bright costumes swirling in the cool breeze. The Faire has also brought its own mechanical marvels: sea-themed contraptions like a clockwork kraken that sprays mist from its tentacles and a miniature ship that sails through the air, suspended by unseen magical threads.

Together, the Day of Wonders and the Sea Maiden's Faire transform Waterdeep into a place of enchantment and marvels, where the boundaries between magic, technology, and spectacle blur, offering a day of wonder that will linger in the memories of all who witness it.

# Day of Wonders Parade (pg 146)
The Day of Wonders is the grandest parade of the fall season. The imaginative inventions of the Gondar are revealed on this day and paraded through the city. These devices range from something as humble as new cabinet hinges to massive mechanical constructs that walk or roll about. Failure is the paramour of invention though, meaning it is a rare year when there isn't some notable disruption of the celebration. The flying chair of Marchell was one such recent oddity - a device that worked marvelously on the way up but was incapable of descending. Marchell was rescued by the Griffon Cavalry, but his flying chair drifted away and was never seen again.
